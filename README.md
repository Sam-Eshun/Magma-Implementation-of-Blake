# Magma Implementation of Blake-224 Round 2 of SHA-3 (A Cryptography Course-2016)
##Magma Implementation of Blake-224 Round 2

Blake is part of the 14-finalist of the second round candidates of the NIST hash competition which
meets all the criteria set by NIST. Blake follows an iteration mode which is similar to HAIFA the
improved version of Merkle -Damgard paradigm. Blake is one of the simplest designs of the hash
function to implement with its structure rallying on Chacha.
